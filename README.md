## About us

<p align="justify">We are a dynamic team comprised of five Computer Science students hailing from Swinburne University, proudly representing Group 1.3 in the COS20031 class during the vibrant Semester 3 of 2023.</p>

<p align="justify">Our mission centers on mastering IT project management and crafting digital solutions, including websites and web apps. As we advance, we aim to attain significant achievements and accolades while continually expanding our knowledge and capabilities.</p>

## Project description

<p align="justify">We developed functions on the current website of <a href="https://greeliving.edu.vn/">Greeliving</a>. The current web platform faces critical challenges in UI/UX optimization, database efficiency, and security. These challenges impact job-seekers, who lack clarity on needed skills and struggle to find suitable job opportunities. The absence of a secure authentication system, role-based access control, and user profile management poses significant risks. Additionally, the platform lacks crucial features for personalized user experiences, job transparency, and privacy in recruitment. These shortcomings compromise project objectives, affecting both the user experience and security standards.</p>
